   3. Click on "Create" at the top
   4. Fill in required authentication details using one of the schemes below:

### OAuth

Conn Type: HTTP
Host: api.bdrk.ai
Schema: https
Extra: a JSON object containing `client_id` and `client_secret` (received from Auth0),
       e.g. {"client_id": "some_client_id", "client_secret": "some_client_secret"}
```

## Run a DAG

1. Copy `examples/bedrock_dag.py` to `airflow/dags/` (here `airflow` is your Airflow folder)
2. Update GitHub credentials passed to `CreatePipelineOperator` to match your own repository, including
```
uri: link to repository on GitHub, e.g. "https://github.com/org/example.git"
ref: branch name or commit id, e.g. "master"
username: username if repository is private (Optional)
password: password or access token for the private repository (Optional)
```
3. Run `bedrock_dag` from airflow UI or individual tasks from the command line, for e.g.
```bash
$> airflow test bedrock_dag create 2019-05-21
```
4. [Optional] Login to https://bedrock.basis-ai.com to verify that the training pipeline has been created
